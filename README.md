# SHOOK
###OUR GOAL

A bet is an agreement that is made between two parties that involves a wager. What happened when someone breaks that agreement? With Shook, you can record every bet you made with your friends and foes. We aimed to create a website where we bring friendly competitions to another level. Now you can extort money from your friends in the form of fun.

###FEATURES
Quick and easy to create a bet. Send the generated link to a friend to seal the deal.
Accounts to keep track of wins and losses

###HOW TO USE
Create an account if you do not have one and log in.

Input the desired bet and consolation prize into the appropriate fields.

Click create bet.

Share the link with a friend.

Have the friend agree.

After a winner has been decided, return to the link and choose the winner.

You may access your previous bets using the bets history page.
###HOW WE STARTED

Within 36 hours, we finished this project for HackUMass IV. Our inspiration for our idea is none other than the author of this about page, Wilson Chong Mei. He would always make bets and back out of them. Therefore we created this website to keep track of our extortions.

###UPCOMING FEATURES
Incorporating multiple people

Notifications and reminders about the bet.

Viewing all bets that you are currently in.
